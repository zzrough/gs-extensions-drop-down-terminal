ROADMAP:

v4
TODO: tag back v2 (rewrite history with NEWS date)

- feature: check for dependencies at startup (asked by l300lvl -- Debian distributes gir files in their own packages)
- feature: copy/paste via popupmenu + shortcuts (ctrl-shift'ed) + dnd
- feature: multi tabs
- feature: detect active pid and ask before exiting the shell? (or detach it?)
- feature: test on multihead: global.screen.connect('monitors-changed', ...)

- code: switch to window-manager for window handling?
- code: investigate if the inner-border can be retrieved
- code: investigate argb colors not working
- code review

v5
- feature: more preferences (early fork?, other term options?)
- bugfix: investigate the focus issue preventing using the BLOCK cursor

v6
- feature: pause the child process if term closed and no active pid (for powersaving, maybe an additional pref?)
