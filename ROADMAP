ROADMAP:

- bugfix: better height preference UI (github #5)
- bugfix: no focus given on ctrl-alt-tab (github #8)

v7
- feature (maybe): multi tabs (2 votes for, 2 votes against, andyfitz: tabs would just clutter it up)

- bugfix: investigate the focus issue preventing using the BLOCK cursor
- bugfix (maybe): add icon/name to panel (github #7)

- code: investigate argb colors not working

v8
- feature: pause the child process if term closed and no active pid (for powersaving, maybe an additional pref?)
